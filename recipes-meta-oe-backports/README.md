This folder shall only contain copies from recent meta-oe recipes that are integrated because
of missing dependencies for KDE libraries and applications. Note that there is no harm in providing
an outdated recipe when also a new meta-oe layer is integrated, because the newer layer then is used.

Recipes shall be grouped by the oldest layer for which the recipe is required for compatibilty in order
to ease later cleaning of obsolete recipes.
